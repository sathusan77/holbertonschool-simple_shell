HSH(1)                         Simple Shell                        HSH(1)

NAME
       hsh - simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       ./hsh
       echo "command" | ./hsh

DESCRIPTION
       hsh is a simple UNIX shell written in C as part of the
       Holberton School curriculum.

       It displays a prompt, reads user input, parses commands,
       resolves executable paths, and executes programs using
       fork() and execve().

       The shell works in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

FEATURES
       - Displays a prompt when running in interactive mode
       - Reads input using getline
       - Parses commands separated by spaces
       - Resolves commands using the PATH environment variable
       - Executes commands with fork and execve
       - Handles Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
       - Implements the built-in commands: exit and env

BUILT-IN COMMANDS
       exit [status]
              Exits the shell.
              If no status is provided, exits with the last command status.
              If status is provided, exits with status modulo 256.
              If status is invalid, exits with status 2.

       env
              Prints the current environment.

PATH RESOLUTION
       - If the command starts with '/' or './', it is treated as a direct path
       - Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the PATH directories
       - If the command is not found, an error message is printed

ERROR HANDLING
       - Command not found: exit status 127
       - Permission denied or directory execution: exit status 126
       - Invalid exit argument: exit status 2

EXIT STATUS
       The shell exits with the status of the last executed command.

EXAMPLES
       Interactive mode:
              $ ./hsh
              $ ls
              $ exit

       Non-interactive mode:
              echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
